Mad Lib File Exercise
Write madlib3.py, a small modification of madlib2.py, requiring only a modification to the main function
of madlib2.py. (Even better is to start from madlib2a.py if you did the exercise in Unique List Exercise
(page 132)). Also create a file myMadlib.txt, as described below.
Your madlib3.py should
• Prompt the user for the name of a file that should contain a madlib format string as text (with no quotes around
it).
• Read in this file and use it as the format string in the tellStory function.
This is unlike in madlib2.py, where the story is a literal string coded directly into the program, assigned to the variable
originalStory. The tellstory function and particularly the getKeys function were developed and described
in detail in this tutorial, but for this exercise there is no need to follow their inner workings - you are just a user of
the tellstory function (and the functions that it calls). You do not need to mess with the code for the definition of
tellStory or any of the earlier supporting functions – just keep them from the copy you made of madlib2.py for
your madlib3.py. The original madlib string is already placed in a file jungle.txt as an example of the story file
format expected. With the Idle editor, write another madlib format string into a file myMadlib.txt. If you earlier
created a program myMadlib.py, then you can easily extract the story from there (without the quotes around it). Test
your program madlib3.py twice, using jungle.txt and then your new madlib story file myMadlib.txt.
