Pairs Having Similar Elements

Given an array,A, having N integers A1,A2,.....,AN .Two elements of the array Ai and Aj are called similar iff Ai=Aj+1 or Aj=Ai+1 .
Also, the similarity follows transitivity. If Ai and Aj are similar and Ai and Ak are similar, then Ai and Ak are also similar. 
Note: i, j, and k are all distinct.

You need to find number of pairs of indices (i,j) such that i<j and Ai is similar to Aj.

Input

The first line contains a single integer N denoting number of elements in the array.
The second line contains N space separated integers where ith elements indicate Ai.

Output

Output the number of pairs of indices (i,j) such that i<j and Ai is similar to Aj in a single line.

constraints

1<=N<=10^6
10^-9<=Ai<=10^9
