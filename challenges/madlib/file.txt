There once was a girl called Alex and she had a huge crush on a boy called Gira. She kept on asking him to go out with her but he kept on saying, "No." So Alex decided to give him some payback for saying, "No," to her. She took his sandwich out of his school bag and put a Matoke sandwich in its place. When it was lunch time Gira took his sandwich out of his bag and took a huge bite out it. Gira yelled out, "GROSS!" Everyone started to laugh at him. He was so embarassed. Then Alex went up to him and asked if he would go out with her and he said, "Yes."
